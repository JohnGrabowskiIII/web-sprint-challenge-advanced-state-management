# Interview Answers
Be prepared to demonstrate your understanding of this week's concepts by answering questions on the following topics. These will not be counted as a part of your sprint score but will be helpful for preparing you for your endorsement interview, and enhancing overall understanding.

1. What problem does the context API help solve?
    the context api allows us to access a "store", or a repository of state, throughout the app.

2. In your own words, describe `actions`, `reducers` and the `store` and their role in Redux. What does each piece do? Why is the store known as a 'single source of truth' in a redux application?
    Reducers take two pieces of data, and return one. In the context of Redux the two pieces of data are the state you wish to affect, and an object (or action). Based off this the reduces makes the correct change to state (returning the new state object)

    An action, in the context of redux, is an object with the key 'type', which bears a descriptive name for what the action wishes to accomplish. It may also include a 'payload' key which is where relevant data for the change is stored

    The store is an object that holds state for (usually) the entire application. 

3. What does `redux-thunk` allow us to do? How does it change our `action-creators`?
    redux-thunk allows us to employ asynchronous code within our action creators.

4. What is your favorite state management system you've learned and this sprint? Please explain why!
    It is hard to pick a favorite. Redux is good for larger applications, but maybe unneccessary for smaller ones.
